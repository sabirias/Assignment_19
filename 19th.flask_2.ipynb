    "GET and POST are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods used in web development for \n",
    "different purposes. They define how data is sent between the client (browser) and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose:The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. It is a safe \n",
    "and idempotent operation, meaning it should not have side effects, and multiple identical\n",
    "requests should produce the same result as a single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Submission: Data is submitted as part of the URL, typically in the query string. \n",
    "For example, in a URL like `http://example.com/page?name=John&age=25`, the data parameters\n",
    "(name and age) are sent using the GET method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security: GET requests are less secure for sensitive data because the data is visible in\n",
    "the URL, and URLs may be logged in various places like browser history and server logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Caching: GET requests can be cached, which can improve performance for repeated requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Idempotence: Repeated GET requests should not have additional side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Example: Retrieving information from a database, fetching a web page, or loading an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. \n",
    "It is not idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests may have different effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Submission: Data is submitted in the request body, and it is not visible in the URL. \n",
    "This makes it suitable for sending sensitive or large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security: POST requests are more secure for sensitive data as the data is not visible in the URL.\n",
    "    However, they are not inherently secure, and additional measures like encryption (HTTPS) should\n",
    "be considered for sensitive transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Caching: POST requests are not cached by default. Each request is typically processed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Idempotence: Repeated POST requests may have different effects, so it is not considered idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Example: Submitting a form, uploading a file, or making changes to a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while both GET and POST are used to exchange data between the client and server,\n",
    "they have different use cases and characteristics. GET is typically used for retrieving data,\n",
    "while POST is used for submitting data. The choice between them depends on the nature of the\n",
    "operation and the type of data being transferred."

    "In Flask, templates are used to separate the presentation (HTML, CSS, etc.) \n",

    "data when the page is rendered. Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key aspects of templates in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jinja2 Templating Engine: Flask uses Jinja2 as its template engine. Jinja2 allows \n",
    "you to embed dynamic content, control structures (if statements, loops), and template\n",

    "\n",

    "curly braces (`{{ }}`) to represent variables that will be replaced with actual data \n",
    "when rendering the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Control Structures: Jinja2 supports control structures such as `{% if ... %} ... {% endif %}` \n",
    "for conditional statements and `{% for ... %} ... {% endfor %}` for loops, enabling dynamic \n",
    "content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Template Inheritance: Templates can be structured hierarchically using template inheritance,\n",
    "where a base template defines the overall structure, and child templates extend or override \n",
    "specific blocks of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `render_template()` function in Flask is used to render templates and return the result\n",
    "as a response to the client's web browser. It takes the name of the template file\n",
    "(or a list of template files) as its argument and can also accept additional keyword \n",
